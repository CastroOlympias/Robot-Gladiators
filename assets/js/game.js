// Some of thee screenshots from the instructions make it real hard to know where to place new code.
// to me, the instructions say, place code in startGame function, and I'm thinknig, which one?
// I follow a long fine for bit, then suddenly, the where do I put code, then tones of changes along the way
// then lets check to see how we're doing, and it's way broke.

// The below is an ambiguous instruction. to place the randomNumber function alongside the other functions? Where is this, what is 'other'functions? along the side could be middle, end start. I got to the random enemy health, but not the random attack, and now the 2nd and 3rd robot have no health. I'm thinking to place it right below, but not with the body of the fight function.

//Play the game again and notice how each enemy starts with a different health value. Success! There are still other places where we could use a random number, though, making this a good use case for a function.

//Add the following function alongside the other functions in game.js:

// function to generate a random numeric value
//var randomNumber = function() {
//  var value = Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) + 40;

 // return value;
//};
